# collector-env

## Getting started
There is a UI application which allows you to manually control the agent in the `collector-env` with the arrow keys 
(for navigation) and the `page up`-key (for picking up an item).

Run it with:

```
git clone https://github.com/mschweizer/collector-env
cd collector-env
python manual_control.py --env Collector-v0
```
